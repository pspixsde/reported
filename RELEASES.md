## v1.0.0 — Launch!

**Reported** is live at [reported-dota.org](https://reported-dota.org)!

A Wordle-inspired guessing game for Dota 2 players. You see a real ranked match with an unusual build and guess what happened.

### Game Modes

- **Daily Challenge** — one puzzle per day, same for everyone
- **Puzzles** — 30 puzzles in regular mode, 30 in hard mode — complete them all at your own pace

### Hard Mode

The hero is hidden. Guess it from the items alone, then continue with Win/Loss, KDA, and Rank — 4 levels, scored out of 4.

### Features

- Global stats: see what % of players guessed each level correctly
- "Would you report this build?" — vote and see what others think
- Share your results with friends (copy-paste or screenshot)
- Progress saved automatically — leave and come back anytime
- Colorblind mode available in Settings

### Languages

English, Russian, Spanish, and Portuguese.
